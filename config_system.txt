Xampp Virtual Host
We will configure a Virtual Host in Xampp for a Laravel project, and in this example, we want to configure the domain laravel.dev for our project.

We need to edit httpd-vhosts.conf that is located in C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf and add following lines at the end of the file:

# VirtualHost for LARAVEL.DEV

<VirtualHost laravel.dev:80>
  DocumentRoot "C:\xampp\htdocs\laravel\public"
  ServerAdmin laravel.dev
  <Directory "C:\xampp\htdocs\laravel">
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

After this, our apache is listening to laravel.dev connections, but we have to configure our hosts file that allows to redirect laravel.dev to the localhost that is located in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc

IMPORTANT!: To edit this file, maybe we should give access, click properties and allow your user to modify this file.
Edit hosts file adding our localhost for laravel.dev:

# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
#	127.0.0.1       localhost
#	::1             localhost

127.0.0.1	laravel.dev
